## Goal

Build and refine the "projects" OpenClaw skill — an autonomous project management system that enables Zane to work on multiple long-running projects in the background with iterative delivery, parallel sub-agent execution, and structured check-ins.

## Guardrails

- Changes to the skill definition go in `/Users/micahmartin/openclaw/skills/projects/SKILL.md`
- Test workflow changes by using this project as the guinea pig
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Ask before making changes that affect other skills or OpenClaw config
