# Iteration 003

Status: planning

## Stories
- projects-skill-5cs: Set up a notification channel for projects-skill project
- projects-skill-1xn: Add progress dashboard: auto-generate STATUS.md across all projects
- projects-skill-z15: Formalize worker error handling and escalation path
- projects-skill-qc0: Validate multi-project support with concurrent active projects
- projects-skill-9yv: Auto-generate iteration retrospective on completion
- projects-skill-4bq: Worker should explicitly handle bead dependency chains

## Guardrails
- Multi-project validation (qc0) depends on zane-setup project existing and being active
- Dashboard and retrospective features should be added to SKILL.md and worker.md

## Notes
- First iteration running alongside a second real project (zane-setup)
- P1 stories are polish items that directly improve reliability for real-project usage
- P2 stories expand capability and can carry to iteration 004 if needed
